# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the project!

If you are interested in contributing, please follow these golden rules when contributing:

- **First steps**. The project has some dependencies, i.e. python, pip requirements
  <br>
  <details>
  <summary><b>More detailed steps</b></summary>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a><br>(Install the recommended version as indicated in  <code>.python-version</code> or consider using <code>pyenv</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
    Install pip requirements from <code>requirements.txt</code>
    Note: You might want to use a virtual environment: <code>python3 -m venv venv</code>
    </li>

  </details>
  <br>

- **Make great commits**. Great commits should be atomic, with a commit message explaining what and why. Please also avoid making minor commits for fixing typos or linting errors ( Don’t forget to lint before you push! ). A more in-depth guide to writing great commit messages can be found in Chris Beam's [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). And also apart from semi-detailed commit description, please try to use these prefixes in the commit title whenever applicable:

  - `[+]` => When adding a feature
  - `[+/-]` => When updating a feature
  - `[+] docs:` => Pertaining to docs

  ( Note: Clearly these prefixes do not cover all cases, but adhering to them whenever possible is great when you are referring to commit history )

- **Do not open a pull request if you aren't assigned to the issue**. If someone is already working on it, consider offering to collaborate with that person.
- **Use assets licensed for public use**. Whenever the assets are images, audio or even code, they must have a license compatible with the project.

Do note that failing to comply with the guidelines may lead to a rejection of the contribution.

If you are confused by any of these rules, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/sswastik02/matrix-decomposer/issues/new?title=Question%3A%3C-Your%20Question%20goes%20here-%3E&body=%3C!--%20Write%20details%20here%20--%3E) with prefix _question_ in the title.
